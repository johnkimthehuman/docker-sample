<h2>Introduction</a></h2>

<p>It is both improbable and veritably futile to verify indubitably that that which is seen is seen and that which is heard is heard and so on and so forth, due to the existence of a biological API, paradoxically serving both to sever and link us to the corporeal realm, which is serviced by a core library known as signal transduction and which at the present moment, most lamentably, is closed source. </p>

<h2>Basic Information</h2>

<p>I am a person of the male variety who was born in 1995 in the USA,
and have lived in roughest area of Loudon County most of my life.  I am
a single male who still lives with his parents.</p>

<p>By profession, I am a software engineer.  Although I no longer
spend the majority of my time coding, I have, over the years, found
myself focusing primarily on tools development, and I still write code
in that area.  I also write some code in my spare time, and I consider
the creation of good software to be both a vocation and an avocation.
It is something that is a core part of who I am, and I consider myself
very fortunate to be able to spend my days getting paid to do what I
like to do.  I am also a musician and have other interests that fall
completely outside the world of technology.</p>

<h2>Employment</h2>

</p>As of August 2017, I am working
for <a href="http://www.appian.com">Appian</a>.  Appian offers a
business process management software package and professional services
surrounding their product and business process management.  My job
there is to focus on their software development infrastructure.
Appian is an exciting place for a software engineer to work.  There's
a robust process in place, and the pace is fast.  My job there
includes both software development and some information
technology/system administration work.  I am equally comfortable
wearing both hats, and I'm happiest when I can wear both at the same
time, as my current job requires me to do.  After 0 years working
mostly in a C/C++/Perl environment and mostly on Linux or UNIX
systems, this is my first foray into the Java EE space.  I'm looking
forward to gaining greater expertise in that arena while improving the
robustness of Appian's software and development process over time.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I have zero intersts.</p>

<h2>Closing Remark</h2>

<p>I hope you've enjoyed reading this page. Please don't contact me.</p>
