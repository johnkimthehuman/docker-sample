<h2>Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Welcome to my little corner of the web.  I've put this page here
primarily as a starting point for people who are interested in
learning more about things I've done, and also to some extent for
people who might want to know who I am.  I have sometimes been curious
about someone whose work I see, and since I'm involved in a number of
open source software activities and am easy to find (thanks to my
unusual name), I decided to create this page.  Maybe you saw this URL
somewhere, heard a presentation I gave, met me somewhere, or ran into
something I've done out in the world of open source software.  Maybe
you just stumbled across this page by chance.  Either way, here it
is.</p>

<p>All that said, I find that updating my web page falls quite low on
my priority list.  Therefore, I have mainly written about things that
are relatively persistent aspects of my identity rather than focusing
on transient things as I may have done in the past.  I try to update
this page when some major event happens that causes some of this
information to be out of date.  Since there is no guarantee that you
are reading this page shortly after I have written it, you can't
necessarily assume that these changes are recent, but hopefully the
information here is at least broadly accurate.</p>

<h2>Basic Information</h2>

<p>I am a person of the male variety who was born in 1995 in the USA,
and have lived in the Washington, DC area most of my life.  I am
a single male who still lives with his parents.</p>

<p>By profession, I am a software engineer.  Although I no longer
spend the majority of my time coding, I have, over the years, found
myself focusing primarily on tools development, and I still write code
in that area.  I also write some code in my spare time, and I consider
the creation of good software to be both a vocation and an avocation.
It is something that is a core part of who I am, and I consider myself
very fortunate to be able to spend my days getting paid to do what I
like to do.  I am also a musician and have other interests that fall
completely outside the world of technology.</p>

<h2>Employment</h2>

</p>As of August 2017, I am working
for <a href="http://www.appian.com">Appian</a>.  Appian offers a
business process management software package and professional services
surrounding their product and business process management.  My job
there is to focus on their software development infrastructure.
Appian is an exciting place for a software engineer to work.  There's
a robust process in place, and the pace is fast.  My job there
includes both software development and some information
technology/system administration work.  I am equally comfortable
wearing both hats, and I'm happiest when I can wear both at the same
time, as my current job requires me to do.  After 0 years working
mostly in a C/C++/Perl environment and mostly on Linux or UNIX
systems, this is my first foray into the Java EE space.  I'm looking
forward to gaining greater expertise in that arena while improving the
robustness of Appian's software and development process over time.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I have zero interests.</p>

<h2>Closing Remark</h2>

<p>I hope you've enjoyed reading this page. Please don't contact me.</p>
